**üî¨ INCREMENTAL LIFT ANALYSIS:**

**Method 1: Cross-Brand Control Group (Superior Method):**

| **Product** | **Brand** | **Ad Status** | **Sales Lift** | **Market Baseline** | **True Ad Effect** | **Ad ROI** |
|:-----------|:----------|:--------------|:---------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:-----------|
| Brake Pads | Honda Civic | ‚úÖ Has Ads | +25% (+$2,500) | +12% (from Toyota) | +13% (+$1,300) | **2.6X ROAS** |
| Brake Pads | Toyota Camry | ‚ùå No Ads | +12% (+$600) | +12% (market lift) | 0% (+$0) | **Control Group** |
| Brake Pads | Ford F-150 | ‚ùå No Ads | +11% (+$550) | +12% (market lift) | 0% (+$0) | **Control Group** |
| Air Filters | Honda Civic | ‚úÖ Has Ads | +18% (+$900) | +8% (from Toyota) | +10% (+$500) | **5.0X ROAS** |
| Air Filters | Toyota Camry | ‚ùå No Ads | +8% (+$320) | +8% (market lift) | 0% (+$0) | **Control Group** |

**Method 2: Correlated Product Analysis (Previous Example):**

| **Product** | **Ad Status** | **Sales Lift** | **Organic Baseline** | **Direct Ad Effect** | **True Ad ROI** |
|:-----------|:--------------|:---------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:----------------|
| Brake Pads Honda Civic | ‚úÖ Has Ads | +20% (+$2,000) | +10% (from air filter) | +10% (+$1,000) | **2.0X ROAS** |
| Air Filter Honda Civic | ‚ùå No Ads | +10% (+$500) | +10% (organic lift) | 0% (+$0) | **Halo Effect** |

**üìä ATTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY:**

**1. Cross-Brand Control Group Analysis (Your Superior Method):**
```
Market Baseline = Average lift of non-advertised competing brands
True Ad Effect = Advertised Brand Lift - Market Baseline
True ROAS = (True Ad Effect Revenue) / Ad Spend
Statistical Confidence = T-test between advertised vs control groups
```

**Example Calculation:**
```javascript
// Honda Civic Brake Pads (with ads): +25% = $2,500 revenue increase
// Toyota Camry Brake Pads (no ads): +12% = $600 revenue increase  
// Ford F-150 Brake Pads (no ads): +11% = $550 revenue increase

Market Baseline = (12% + 11%) / 2 = 11.5%
True Honda Ad Effect = 25% - 11.5% = 13.5%
True Ad Revenue = $2,500 * (13.5/25) = $1,350
Ad Spend = $500
True ROAS = $1,350 / $500 = 2.7X
```

**2. Product Correlation Matrix:**
```
High Correlation (Same Category): Honda vs Toyota vs Ford Brake Pads
Medium Correlation (Related): Brake Pads vs Brake Rotors vs Brake Fluid
Low Correlation (Different): Brake Pads vs Air Fresheners
```

**3. Statistical Validation:**
* **Minimum Sample Size**: 30 days of data per brand
* **Confidence Level**: 95% statistical significance required
* **Control Group Quality**: R¬≤ > 0.7 correlation in historical data

| Amazon Air Filters | $4,200 | $3,800 | $3,500 | **+$400** | Apparent: 2.8X ‚Üí True: **1.6X** |

**‚ö†Ô∏è KEY INSIGHTS:**
* **Organic Lift**: Market conditions driving +15% baseline growth across automotive parts
* **Halo Effect**: Honda brake pad ads driving +8% sales on related Honda parts (no ads)
* **True Incrementality**: Only 60% of apparent ad-driven sales are truly incremental

* **Product Category Mapping**: Standardized categories (brake pads, air filters, oil filters) across brands
* **Ad Spend Attribution**: Which specific brands/models have active advertising campaigns
* **Historical Correlation**: 12+ months of sales data to establish baseline correlations
* **Competitive Set Definition**: Logical control groups (same vehicle class, price range, market segment)

**Implementation Steps:**

**Step 1: Product Correlation Matrix Creation**
```sql
-- Example SQL for correlation analysis
SELECT 
  p1.brand as advertised_brand,
  p2.brand as control_brand,
  p1.category,
  CORR(p1.daily_sales, p2.daily_sales) as correlation_coefficient
FROM product_sales p1
JOIN product_sales p2 ON p1.category = p2.category 
WHERE p1.brand != p2.brand
  AND p1.has_ads = true 
  AND p2.has_ads = false
  AND correlation_coefficient > 0.7
```

**Step 2: Control Group Selection Algorithm**
```javascript
// Automatically select best control brands
function selectControlGroups(advertisedProduct) {
  const controls = products
    .filter(p => p.category === advertisedProduct.category)
    .filter(p => p.hasAds === false)
    .filter(p => p.correlationWith(advertisedProduct) > 0.7)
    .sort((a, b) => b.salesVolume - a.salesVolume)
    .slice(0, 3); // Use top 3 control brands
  
  return controls;
}
```

**Step 3: Automated Attribution Calculation**
```javascript
function calculateTrueROAS(advertisedBrand, controlBrands, timeWindow) {
  const adLift = advertisedBrand.getSalesLift(timeWindow);
  const controlLift = controlBrands.map(b => b.getSalesLift(timeWindow));
  const marketBaseline = controlLift.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / controlLift.length;
  
  const trueAdEffect = adLift - marketBaseline;
  const trueAdRevenue = advertisedBrand.revenue * (trueAdEffect / adLift);
  const trueROAS = trueAdRevenue / advertisedBrand.adSpend;
  
  return {
    apparentROAS: advertisedBrand.revenue / advertisedBrand.adSpend,
    trueROAS: trueROAS,
    marketLift: marketBaseline,
    adLift: trueAdEffect,
    confidence: calculateStatisticalSignificance(adLift, controlLift)
  };
}
```
