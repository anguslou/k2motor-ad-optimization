**5\. Technical Feasibility and Implementation Considerations**

The solution will be implemented using Python, leveraging open-source libraries and direct API interactions to minimize reliance on third-party paid tools.

**5.1. API Availability and Limitations**

* **Core Data Accessibility**: Most core advertising performance, sales, inventory, and product catalog data is programmatically accessible via official Amazon (Advertising API v3, SP-API) and eBay (Marketing API, Browse API, Fulfillment API, Inventory API, Taxonomy API).  
* **Data Freshness and Latency**:  
  * **Amazon**: Amazon Marketing Stream offers near real-time (hourly) traffic and conversion data, enabling more dynamic bid adjustments. Standard Advertising API reports are daily, with conversion data subject to restatement for up to 42 days.  
  * **eBay**: Marketing API reports are daily, with sales and ad fee data potentially taking up to 72 hours for reconciliation. This limits programmatic adjustments to daily or longer cycles based on finalized data.  
* **API Rate Limits**: Both platforms impose rate limits, which will necessitate robust error handling, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and potentially intelligent caching to manage high-frequency data fetching for large catalogs.  
* **Data Gaps**:  
  * **Raw Search Queries**: Neither platform provides direct API access to the full, unfiltered stream of all user search queries.  
  * **Marketplace Insight Tools**: Programmatic API access to comprehensive market research tools like Amazon Product Opportunity Explorer and eBay Terapeak is currently unconfirmed or limited.  
  * **Competitor Stock/Velocity**: Direct API access to competitor stock levels or sales velocity is generally not provided.  
  * **Product Reviews (Amazon)**: Amazon's seller-facing APIs typically do not provide product review text or aggregated ratings/counts.  
* **Fitment Data**: eBay has a robust structured fitment data ecosystem accessible via its Taxonomy and Inventory (Product Compatibility) APIs, which is a key advantage for automotive parts. Amazon relies more on detailed listing attributes.  
* **Buyer Identification for CAC**: eBay's `buyer.username` field in the Fulfillment API allows for more robust programmatic tracking of new vs. repeat customers compared to Amazon's stricter PII restrictions.

**5.2. Recommended Algorithms and Python Libraries**

* **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy.  
* **Supervised Learning (Regression/Classification)**: scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, RandomForestRegressor), XGBoost (for ROI prediction, CVR prediction, price elasticity, sales potential, fraud detection).  
* **Time Series Forecasting**: Facebook Prophet, statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA) (for sales trends, seasonal demand, inventory/demand forecasting).  
* **Reinforcement Learning**: NumPy (for custom Q-learning/Contextual Bandits), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for Deep Q-Networks) (for dynamic bid/budget allocation, adaptive pricing).  
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLTK, spaCy (for text preprocessing, keyword extraction, Named Entity Recognition), scikit-learn (TF-IDF, NMF, LDA), Gensim (for topic modeling), VADER, TextBlob (for sentiment analysis).  
* **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Pillow (for product image quality improvement, cropping, background removal, superimposition).  
* **API Interaction**: `requests` library.

**5.3. Hardware Requirements**

* **GPU**: Minimum NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Super (6GB VRAM) for NLP model acceleration (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec) and predictive model training.  
* **Network**: A stable 100Mbps wired internet connection to handle API data transmission.
