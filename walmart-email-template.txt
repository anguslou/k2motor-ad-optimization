Subject: API Access Request - Marketplace Integration (Client ID: ac006d0a-76cc-44b2-b074-5c7588e9b964)

Dear Walmart Marketplace Support Team,

I am writing to request API access for our Walmart seller account. We have successfully configured OAuth authentication but are receiving 401 Unauthorized errors when attempting to access marketplace APIs.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Client ID: ac006d0a-76cc-44b2-b074-5c7588e9b964
- OAuth Status: Working (tokens generate successfully)
- Environment: Production
- Seller Account: [Your Seller ID - find in Partner Center]

PURPOSE:
We are developing a marketplace optimization platform that requires READ-ONLY access to:
- Order data for performance tracking
- Inventory levels for monitoring
- Item information for analytics
- Reports for business insights

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Integration Type: REST API
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 (already configured)
- Access Level: READ-ONLY ONLY (no write operations)
- Use Case: Performance analytics and optimization

BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:
This integration will help us optimize our Walmart marketplace performance through better inventory management, improved pricing strategies, and data-driven decision making.

CURRENT STATUS:
OAuth token generation works perfectly (900-second tokens), but all API endpoints return 401 Unauthorized, indicating we need marketplace API access approval.

REQUEST:
Please approve API access for our account. We are ready for immediate integration and committed to read-only access only.

Thank you for your assistance. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
