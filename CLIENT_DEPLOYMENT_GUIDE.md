# K2Motor Dashboard - Client Testing Deployment

## üéØ Goal: Get Dashboard to Non-Technical Client for Testing

### ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED: Netlify Deployment (Free & Instant)**

**Why Netlify?**
- ‚úÖ Client just clicks a link - no technical knowledge needed
- ‚úÖ Free hosting for static sites
- ‚úÖ Automatic HTTPS with professional URL
- ‚úÖ Easy updates when you make changes
- ‚úÖ Perfect for dashboard demos

**Steps to Deploy:**

1. **Prepare the dashboard folder for static hosting:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Volumes/SSD/Hivebot Projects/K2Motor"
   # Copy dashboard folder to netlify-deploy
   cp -r dashboard netlify-deploy
   cd netlify-deploy
   ```

2. **Create index.html in root (if needed):**
   - Ensure the main dashboard file is named `index.html`
   - Or create a redirect from root to dashboard

3. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop the `netlify-deploy` folder
   - Get instant URL like: `https://k2motor-dashboard-abc123.netlify.app`

4. **Share with client:**
   ```
   Subject: K2Motor Dashboard Ready for Review

## üîÑ **Alternative Options:**

### Option 2: Vercel (Similar to Netlify)
- Also free, drag-and-drop deployment
- Professional URLs and HTTPS
- Good alternative if Netlify doesn't work

### Option 3: GitHub Pages (If using GitHub)
- Free hosting from GitHub repository
- URL: `https://username.github.io/k2motor-dashboard`
- Good if client wants to see code updates

### Option 4: Send HTML Files via Email
- Zip the dashboard folder
- Client downloads and opens `index.html` in browser
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some browsers block local files, tooltips might not work perfectly

### Option 5: Screen Recording Demo
- Record yourself using the dashboard
- Show all tooltip functionality
- Good for initial presentation, but client can't interact
