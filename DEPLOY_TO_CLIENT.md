### For Client Testing:
- **Give them homework** - "Spend 15 minutes clicking around"
- **Ask specific questions** - "Do you understand why your POAS matters more than ROAS?"
- **Get feedback** - "What would make this more useful for your business?"

The dashboard is now **ready for client testing** with zero technical barriers! 🚀
